# Right Drawer

The right drawer should be used for tasks, cart lists or lists of events:

 - notifications
 - current items in order
 - open tasks

## Dependancy

The right drawer does not provide a button for opening the drawer - only closing it. It is assumed that opening the drawer will be handled else where and that the open state of the RightDrawer component will be updated to reflect this.
